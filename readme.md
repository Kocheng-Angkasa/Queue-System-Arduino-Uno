## About this Project

This project was developed in 2021, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, with the assumption that after its successful development, it can effectively coordinate a queue in a location that typically experiences long queues.

## Tools

- Arduino Uno R3
- Web Simulator (TinkerCad)
- LCD
- Push Button
- Resistor 10 kΩ
- Resistor 220 Ω
- Protoboard

## Disclaimer

- The higher the value of the resistor connected to the Anode Pin of the LED, the dimmer the brightness will be. Conversely, the lower the value of the resistor, the brighter the LED will light up. However, if the value of the resistor is too low or even without a resistor, the LCD may experience excessive heat and burn out.
- The resistor values that can cause the LCD to experience excessive heat and burn out are from 0 to 152 (or without a resistor). Resistor values of 153 and above will not cause the LCD to burn out. As for your choice of using a 220 Ω resistor, it is a common value available in the market.
